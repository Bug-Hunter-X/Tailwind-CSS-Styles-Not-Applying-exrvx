The issue was resolved by ensuring that the `tailwind.config.js` file correctly includes all necessary paths to the components using Tailwind CSS.  Specifically, I added the following line to the 'content' array in `tailwind.config.js`:
```javascript
content: [ 
  './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', // Add this line to include the correct directory
  './index.html',
], 
```
This allowed Tailwind to correctly process and apply the styles to my HTML elements.  Incorrectly configured content paths are a frequent cause of this type of issue.
